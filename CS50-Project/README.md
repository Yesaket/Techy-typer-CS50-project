Firstly, please download the zip file we uploaded. Open VS code and make a new directory within which to place our project. Since we are using Flask, it is important to structure this directory in a specific way. First, add a folder titled “static” in the description, within which please upload our “main.js”, “styles.css” and “stars.jpeg” file. Then create a folder called “templates” which contains all the html pages we uploaded (there should be exactly 8 HTML pages). Lastly, upload the three files labeled “app.py”, “helpers.py” and “project.db” into the directory. These files should be separate and not in the same folder. 

Once the directory has all the necessary files and is looking as it should be, it is time to run the program. On the terminal window in VS code, perform “cd [insert name of directory that our project is in]”. Then on the command-line type “flask run”. Our project does not require any additional features, but to avoid any unnecessary confusion, please ensure that all the features needed to run flask are at your disposal. If you were able to run Pset 9, you should be able to run our project.

One you perform “flask run”, go to our web app by clicking on the port that comes up. First press the register button and make an account, ensuring you have an appropriate username and password. Then, you should be directed to the login page where you should enter your chosen username and password. Once you click on the login button, you will be redirected to the page with our typing game, where you can start playing immediately. If you do not notice the timer running and get a bad start, you can choose to restart the game by pressing the “Restart Game” button, and playing again. You will have 60 seconds to type and one they are done, you will have your words per minute displayed. 

In order to keep track of their progress, the user can choose to submit this score using the submit form. If the user then goes to the “progress” page, the user will see a table of all their previous scores ordered by time. The user also has the option to view the best scores ever recorded on the “records” page. Finally, we have an “About Us” page giving some background to TechyTyper.
